=== reduce

`reduce` reduces a sequence to a single value, or object depending on the function you pass. Take the example below:

[source, clojure]
----
(reduce + [1 2 3 4])
----

Output

----
10
----

To `reduce` we pass function `+` and as a second argument a sequence `[1 2 3 4]`. You can think `reduce` rewrites the code as follows

[source, clojure]
----
(+ 4 (+ 3 (+ 1 2)))
----

This reduces the sequence to a single number 10.

Here is a way to multiply a sequence using reduce:

[source, clojure]
----
(reduce * [1 2 3 4])
----

Output

----
24
----

Let's define our own function `add` which accepts two numbers and returns the result:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn add [a b]
  (+ a b))
----

Output

----
#'user/add
----

We can use it in reduce, just as we used `+` before:

[source, clojure]
----
(reduce add [1 2 3 4])
----

Output

----
10
----

We can imaging reduce rewrites the above code as shown:

[source, clojure]
----
(add 4 (add 3 (add 1 2)))
----

Similarly I wrote my own `multiply` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn multiply [a b]
  (* a b))
----

Output

----
#'user/multiply
----

and used it with `reduce`:

[source, clojure]
----
(reduce multiply [1 2 3 4])
----

Output

----
24
