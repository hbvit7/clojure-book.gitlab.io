== Installing Stuff

=== Clojure

Clojure works on all OS platforms, you can install Clojure following the link here. Once done it's time for us to check the Clojure REPL. To know what is REPL, checkout https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop. Type `clj` in your terminal, and you must get something like this:

----
$ clj
Clojure 1.10.2
user=> 
----

That's the Clojure REPL. Now type `(println "Hello World")` in it as shown below and press kbd:[ENTER]

----
$ clj
Clojure 1.10.2
user=> (println "Hello World")
----

You will see `Hello World` printed out as shown:

----
$ clj
Clojure 1.10.2
user=> (println "Hello World")
Hello World
nil
user=>
----

There is also a `nil` after the `Hello World`, don't worry much about that, we will see what is that later. After the nil you see once again `user=>` which means Cloure is waiting for your type another command for it to execute.

If you want to come out of this Clojure REPL, type kbd:[CTRL + D]. You will get back to normal GNU/Linux prompt.

=== Leningen

Leiningen is a tool that automates some stuff like setting up a Clojure project. Please refer to its website https://leiningen.org/ and install it. Once done type `lein repl` in your terminal, and you will see this:

----
$ lein repl
nREPL server started on port 64285 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:64285

Press kbd:[CTRL+ D] and it should stop. All is well, and you have installed Leningen.


=== Configuring IDE

==== Installing VSCodium

You could use any IDE, but since this is my book, I would take the luxury of suggesting VSCodium. This IDE take the editor made by evil Microsoft and removes the bad part out of it. You could get the IDE here https://vscodium.com/ where the installation instructions are given.

==== Calva
