=== Vectors

:file-name: vectors.clj

include::use_code_note.adoc[]

Image racks with lot of compartments in it, the first compartment is labelled 0, the second 1 and so on. You can put something into this rack and get it back if you know the rack number aka the index. This is a kind of real world analog to vectors.

Look at the code below:

[source, clojure]
----
[1 2 3 4] ; a very simple vector
----


Output

----
[1 2 3 4]
----

This is how you represent a vector in Clojure. It start's with a opening square braces `[` and ends with a closing one `]`, and any thing in between are the elements of the vector. In the above code you got 4 elements namely `1`, `2`, `3` and `4`.

Another way to create a vector is to pass stuff to a function called `vector` as shown below:

[source, clojure]
----
(vector 1 2 3)
----

Output

----
[1 2 3]
----

In the above code we have passed `1`, `2` and `3` to a the function vector and we have got out a vector `[1 2 3]`.

Till now we have seen creating vectors with numbers, in reality you can create vector with any type of value:

[source, clojure]
----
[1 true "Bashir"] ; vector containing multiple data types
----

Output

----
[1 true "Bashir"]
----

In the above code we have created a three element vector with `1` which is a Long, `true` which is boolean (you will learn about them soon), and `"Bashir"` which is a String.

In the code below, we are defining a variable named `friends` and we are assigning a vector that contains four names to it:

[source, clojure]
----
(def friends
    ["Ram" "Bashir" "Antony" "Buddha"])
----

Output

----
#'user/friends
----

Now let's see what is the first element of the vector `friends` is, for that we pass `friends` to a function named `first`:

[source, clojure]
----
(first friends)
----

Output

----
"Ram"
----

and we get the first element in the vector.

There is a function called `rest` which when given a vector, omits the first element and returns the rest of the elements in the vector as shown belo: 

[source, clojure]
----
(rest friends)
----

Output

----
("Bashir" "Antony" "Buddha")
----

As you see `"Ram"` is ignored as it's the first element and the rest is returned.

Let's check the tyoe of `friends`

[source, clojure]
----
(type friends)
----

Output

----
clojure.lang.PersistentVector
----

Fro the output it seems clear that it's a vector, but then let's checkout what type the `rest` returns: 

[source, clojure]
----
(type (rest friends))
----

Output

----
clojure.lang.PersistentVector$ChunkedSeq
----

Though it seems to return `("Bashir" "Antony" "Buddha")`, which are not enclosed in square braces, on querying the type, it seems to be a chunk of the passed in vector.

We can access any element by it's index in a vector using the `nth` function who's first argument should be a vector and second should be the index number as shown: 

[source, clojure]
----
(nth friends 3)
----

Output

----
"Buddha"
----

If you see, at index `3` of `friends` is a String `"Buddha"`.

The third index can also be access like shown:

[source, clojure]
----
(friends 3)
----

Output

----
"Buddha"
----

Doesn't it look like when you did `(def friends <a vector>)`, clojure seems to have constructed a function called `friends` which can take a number, and the value at the index gets returned?

To add an element at the end of vector, use the function `conj` whcih takes in vector as first argument and the value to be added as the second:

[source, clojure]
----
(conj friends "Periyaar")
----

Output

----
["Ram" "Bashir" "Antony" "Buddha" "Periyaar"]
----

In the above code we have added `"Periyaar"` to friends, but this does not mean `friends` as been modified, we can print `friends`: 


[source, clojure]
----
(println friends)
----

Output

----
[Ram Bashir Antony Buddha]
nil
----

and it still shows the old values without `"Periyaar"`, in reality Clojure constructs a new vector when we say `(conj friends "Periyaar")` and returns it out.

To add a element before a vector, use `cons` as shown below:


[source, clojure]
----
(cons "Periyaar" friends)
----

Output

----
("Periyaar" "Ram" "Bashir" "Antony" "Buddha")
----

Does it modify `friends`? Now research what is immutability footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object] in computing.

- How to get total number of elements in a vector?
- What will happen if I give `(friends 42)`?
