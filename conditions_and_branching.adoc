== Conditions and branching

In programming depending on the data or information you gained, the program flow should alter its execution. Say every one can visit landing page of a website, but when trying to visit a secured page if the person is not logged in he must be challenged with a login screen. For such kind of cases we need to check for conditions and depending on it, we need to branch.

In this section we will see how to do it.
