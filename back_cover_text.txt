Many hackers swear by LISP, and just like any other programmer coming from OOPS background I was skeptical about functional programming. When I started learning it, it wasn't straight forward (for an OOP developer), but I persisted and when I reached what's called REPL driven development I was blown away.

Clojure is a dialect of LISP, and it was smartly designed to be hosted and not compiled, which means that when you learn it, you can target multiple platforms like Java runtime, Common Language Runtime, JavaScript and Dart platforms, hence your job potential will be huge.

Clojure and all LISP based languages, surprisingly has only one syntax, which makes it simple and unimaginably powerful, and hence makes it easier to learn compared to other languages, and hence I feel it could be great first programming language for many who had never coded before.

Join me in this wonderful journey to learn a dialect of a language which refuses to die and rises like phoenix.
