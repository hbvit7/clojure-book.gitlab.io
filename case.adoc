=== case

Below is an example of `case`, type it and execute it.

[source, clojure]
----
;; case.clj

(let [num 20]
  (case num
    1 "one"
    2 "two"
    3 "three"
    4 "four"
    5 "five"
    "I don't know"))
----

Output

----
"I don't know"
----

We get `"I don't know"`, so what happens. We have set `num` to `20 in `let [num 20]`, then we pass `num` to `case` as shown:

[source, clojure]
----
(case num
  ........)
----

So case check the value of `num`, `num` is not `1`, so the statement `1 "one"` is not touched.

[source, clojure]
----
(case num
    1 "one"
    ........)
----

Similarly, `num` is not `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, so the all the statements below is not touched.

[source, clojure]
----
(case num
  1 "one"
  2 "two"
  3 "three"
  4 "four"
  5 "five"
  ........)
----

So finally the else part "I don't know" is executed as shown below:

[source, clojure]
----
(case num
    ........
    "I don't know")
----

and it gets returned.

As an exercise, remove the "I don't know" and run the code. What do you get? Change `num` to `4` and run the code what do you get? How can you explain it?

When `num` is `4`, and `"I don't know"` is removed, does it matter? Why?

When `num` is `20`, and `"I don't know"` is removed, does it matter? Why?
