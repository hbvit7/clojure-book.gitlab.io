=== apply

Let's take the `+` function, it can add numbers like this:

[source, clojure]
----
(+ 1 2 3 4)
----

Output

----
10
----

But if you give it a sequence, it would fail:


[source, clojure]
----
(+ [1 2 3 4]) ;; error
----

Output

----
; Execution error (ClassCastException) at java.lang.Class/cast (Class.java:3921).
; Cannot cast clojure.lang.PersistentVector to java.lang.Number
----

Now let's pass this `+` and the sequence to `apply` function:


[source, clojure]
----
(apply + [1 2 3 4])
----

Output

----
10
----

And it works. That's because you can imagine apply rewrites the code as shown:

[source, clojure]
----
(+ 1 2 3 4)
----

A sequence could be a vector, list or map, so below we are using it on a list of numbers:

[source, clojure]
----
(apply + '(1 2 3 4))
----

Output

----
10
----

Let me write a function that receives two arguments and all it does is to print it:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-function [arg1 arg2]
  (println "Argument 1:" arg1)
  (println "Argument 2:" arg2))
----

Output

----
#'user/my-function
----

I can use this function by giving two arguments to it:

[source, clojure]
----
(my-function "one" "two")
----

Output

----
Argument 1: one
Argument 2: two
nil
----

If the argument is a vector / sequence containing two elements, this would fail:

[source, clojure]
----
(my-function ["one" "two"]) ;; error
----

Output

----
; Execution error (ArityException) at user/eval2061 (REPL:17).
; Wrong number of args (1) passed to: user/my-function
----

All we need to do is to pass the function and sequence to `apply` for it to work:

[source, clojure]
----
(apply my-function ["one" "two"])
----

Output

----
Argument 1: one
Argument 2: two
nil
----
