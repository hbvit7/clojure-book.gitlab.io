=== cond

What if you want to check multiple conditions and make your code execute according to it. Welcome to `cond` or condition. Take a look at the program below and execute it:

[source, clojure]
----
;; cond.clj

(let [number 5]
  (cond
    (> number 0) (println number "is positive.")
    (< number 0) (println number "is negative.")
    :else (println number "is neither positive nor negative.")))
----

Output

----
5 is positive.
nil
----

It prints `5 is positive`. That's because we have set `number` as `5` in `let [number 5]`. Then the `cond` form is coded like this:

[source, clojure]
----
(cond
    (> number 0) (println number "is positive.")
    (< number 0) (println number "is negative.")
    :else (println number "is neither positive nor negative."))
----

In the above piece of code, when `number` is greater than `0`, it satisfies the condition `(> number 0)` and the code next to it `(println number "is positive.")` gets executed.

Change `number` to negative and execute it, see what happens and explain it. When no condition is satisfied the else part:

[source, clojure]
----
:else (println number "is neither positive nor negative.")
----

gets executed. Make `number` as `0` and execute it, see what happens.

Execute the code below and explain it to yourself.

[source, clojure]
----
(let [number 5]
  (cond
    (> number 0) (println number "is positive.")
    (< number 0) (println number "is negative.")))
----

Make `number` as `0` execute it and see what happens.
