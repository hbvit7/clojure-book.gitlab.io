=== Docstring

Documenting stuff is very important in programming. Clojure provides a way to document functions (which are first class citizens in this language). So look at the code below:

[source, clojure]
----
;; docstring.clj

(defn sum 
  "Adds two numbers passed as arguments.
   
   The arguments should be numbers.

   **Usage**

   ```clojure
   (sum 4 5) ;; returns 9
   ```
  " 
  [a b]
  {:pre [(number? a) (number? b)]}
  (+ a b))

(println (sum 4 5))
----

Right after `(def sum` we have this string:

[source, clojure]
----
"Adds two numbers passed as arguments.
  
  The arguments should be numbers.

  **Usage**

  ```clojure
  (sum 4 5) ;; returns 9
  ```
"
----

This string is nothing but documentation for the function. Note how I have used `**Usage**`, I have used mark down format. I have also used something like this in the doc string:

[source, markdown]
----
```clojure
(sum 4 5) ;; returns 9
```
----

This tells to highlight `(sum 4 5) ;; returns 9` as Clojure code.

One can access documentation for `sum` using the `doc` function as shown:

----
clj꞉user꞉> (doc sum)
-------------------------
user/sum
([a b])
  Adds two numbers passed as arguments.
   
   The arguments should be numbers.

   **Usage**

   ```clojure
   (sum 4 5) ;; returns 9
   ```
  
nil
----

Or better in my VSCodium, all I just need to do is to hover over the function and I get a really neat looking documentation as a popup as shown:
