== Lazy Sequence

Some sequences are evaluated only when they need to be evaluated, these are called lazy sequence. For example you can very easily create a lazy sequence of infinite numbers, or any other thing and your computer won't crash.

It's like this, when I say infinite, your brain doesn't crash, it just knows the concept of infinity and how it would fit into mathematics, when you need to use it in mathematics say in calculus, you still are able to apply and use it.

=== repeat

:file-name: lazy_sequence_repeat.clj

include::use_code_note.adoc[]

So let's take a look at `repeat` function

[source, clojure]
----
(def multiverse (repeat "universe"))
----

[source, clojure]
----
(first multiverse)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(take 5 multiverse)
----

[source, clojure]
----
;; (rest multiverse) ;; doesn't seem to work
----

[source, clojure]
----
;; (last multiverse) ;; doesn't seem to work
----

[source, clojure]
----
(nth multiverse 10,000)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(nth multiverse 100)
----

=== cycle

:file-name: lazy_sequence_cycle.clj

include::use_code_note.adoc[]

[source, clojure]
----
(def multiverse (cycle ["universe" "antiverse"]))
----

[source, clojure]
----
(first multiverse)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(second multiverse)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(take 5 multiverse)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(nth multiverse 2000)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(nth multiverse 1783)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(def tiffin-items
  (cycle ["idli", "vadai", "dosai", "sambar"]))
----

[source, clojure]
----
(nth tiffin-items 5)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(take 10 tiffin-items)
----

=== iterate

:file-name: lazy_sequence_iterate.clj

include::use_code_note.adoc[]

[source, clojure]
----
(def all-numbers (iterate inc 1))
----

[source, clojure]
----
(nth all-numbers 24)
----

[source, clojure]
----
(take 10 all-numbers)
----
