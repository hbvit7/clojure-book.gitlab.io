=== Clojure in file

Till now you might have run your code on REPL, either in your terminal or in your IDE, possibly VSCodium. Now let's see how to store your code in a file and run it. First type the following name in a text editor:


.{code-url}/hello_world.clj[hello_world.clj]
[source, clojure]
----
;; hello_world.clj

(println "Hello World")
----

Save the code as `hello_world.clj`, in your terminal `cd` to that directory, then type this in terminal:

----
$ clj hello_world.clj
----

The entire program will be run and you will see `Hello World` as output. I got this as output:

----
$ clj hello_world.clj
WARNING: Implicit use of clojure.main with options is deprecated, use -M
Hello World
